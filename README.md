# elec_zumoMaze

/* This code is created for an electronics practical to code a Zumo robot to line follow through a complex maze. Whilst the behaviours are
tried to be more general, there is a specificity needed in order to navigate the particular maze design. The learning aim of this practical is 
to program a FSM. The main structure of the program uses a Moore model - ie. the input does not directly influence the output. The 'sub'
program uses a Mealy model, where the next_state is directly influenced by the input. This is to navigate specific features of the maze */
